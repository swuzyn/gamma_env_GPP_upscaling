# γ_env: Environment-regulated Conversion Factor for Upscaling Instantaneous GPP

This repository provides the code implementation for the environment-regulated conversion factor (γ_env) proposed in our study. The method enables robust upscaling of instantaneous GPP observations to daily GPP by explicitly incorporating environmental controls.

The workflow is fully reproducible and consists of two main scripts corresponding to different roles in the manuscript.

## Overview of the Workflow

The framework includes two sequential stages:

1. Model training and evaluation using site-based cross-validation  
2. Independent-site validation using a fully trained model  

Both stages operate on conversion factors (γ) rather than directly predicting daily GPP.

## Script 1: Site-based 10-fold Cross-Validation on FLUXNET 2015

**Script:** `train_gamma_env_rf.py`

### Purpose

This script trains and evaluates the γ_env model using the FLUXNET 2015 eddy-covariance dataset. A strict site-based 10-fold cross-validation strategy is applied, where entire sites are held out in each fold to ensure spatial independence between training and validation data.

### Role in the Manuscript

The out-of-fold (OOF) predictions generated by this script form the core dataset used in the Results section, including:

- Overall estimation accuracy assessment  
- Generalization across ecosystem types  
- Robustness under environmental stress (e.g., RMD gradients)  
- Consistency of diurnal dynamic features (centroid time, AM/PM ratio, peak timing)  

The OOF-predicted γ_env values are mapped back to the original samples and used to compute estimated daily GPP, which serves as the basis for all subsequent statistical analyses and grouped comparisons.

### Key Characteristics

- Site-based (not random) 10-fold cross-validation  
- Prediction target: γ_env (ratio of instantaneous to daily GPP)  
- Machine learning model: Random Forest  
- Hyperparameters determined based on cross-validation performance  
- No direct prediction of daily GPP during training  

### Main Outputs

- A summary CSV reporting cross-validation performance metrics  
- A prediction CSV containing:
  - Observed γ (ratio_GPP_DT)  
  - OOF-predicted γ_env  
  - Estimated daily GPP derived from γ_env  
  - Site and environmental metadata

## Script 2: Independent-Site Evaluation

**Script:** `apply_gamma_env_independent.py`

### Purpose

This script evaluates the transferability of the γ_env model using an independent site dataset that was not involved in model training or cross-validation.

The model is retrained on the entire FLUXNET 2015 dataset using the optimal hyperparameters identified in Script 1 and then applied to the independent dataset.

### Role in the Manuscript

This analysis focuses on overall performance at independent sites and is primarily presented in the Supplementary Materials, with brief reference in the main text.

### Comparison Methods

The script compares three upscaling approaches:

- γ_env (Random Forest, environment-regulated)  
- γ_SW (shortwave radiation ratio method)  
- γ_COS (cosine of solar zenith angle ratio method)  

Daily GPP is estimated as:
Daily GPP = Instantaneous GPP 
for each method.

### Main Outputs

- Printed performance metrics (R², RMSE, MAE, Bias) for each method  
- An output CSV containing:
  - Predicted γ_env  
  - Daily GPP estimates from γ_env, γ_SW, and γ_COS  
  - Observed daily GPP for validation

## Input Data Requirements

### Required Variables (case-insensitive)

- Instantaneous GPP (e.g., `GPP_DT_mean`)  
- Daily GPP reference (e.g., `daily_GPP_DT_mean`)  
- Environmental drivers:
  - Shortwave radiation ratio (`ratio_SW_IN_F`)  
  - Air temperature (`TA_F_mean`)  
  - Vapor pressure deficit (`VPD_F_mean`)  
  - Soil water content (`SWC_F_MDS_1_mean`)  
- γ_COS (for independent evaluation only), representing the cosine-based solar zenith angle ratio  

Column names are matched in a case-insensitive manner to ensure robustness across datasets.

### Data Sources

- Training data: FLUXNET 2015  
- Independent-site data: publicly available eddy-covariance datasets (e.g., ICOS, AmeriFlux), processed following the same methodology  

 A small example dataset may be provided for testing purposes, while complete datasets can be obtained from the respective data portals.

## Reproducibility Notes

- Fixed random seeds are used where applicable  
- Hyperparameter selection relies exclusively on site-based cross-validation  
- No information from validation or independent datasets is used during training
